abstract type that all primitive block will subtype from. A primitive block
is a concrete block who can not be decomposed into other blocks. All composite
block can be decomposed into several primitive blocks.

NOTE: subtype for primitive block with parameter should implement `hash` and `==`
method to enable key value cache.
